  <p>I created <strong>Pack it</strong>, a small web application prototype, to improve the <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> skills I acquiered at <strong><%= link_to 'Le Wagon', "https://www.lewagon.com", target: :_blank %></strong>.</p>
  <p>The application is aimed as a tool for backpackers and hikers to help them plan what they will pack for their next trip.</p>
  <p>In this prototype, the user creates bags to prepare a journey, lists his travel accessories and finally packs part or the totality of them.</p>
  <p>The application displays packing details: the current load’s volume and weight (in liters and in kilos) and the percentage of the bag’s capacity filled.</p>

  <p>Since this application is just a demo, you can provide a fake mail to sign up. Just be sure it is a correct mail pattern.</p>
