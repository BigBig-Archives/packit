# Pack it

> A prototype made with **Ruby on Rails**

> *Work in progress*

Pack it is a small web application prototype aimed as a tool for backpackers and hikers to help them plan what they will pack for their next trip. In this prototype, the user creates bags to prepare a journey, lists his travel accessories and finally packs part or the totality of them. The application displays packing details: the current load’s volume and weight (in liters and in kilos) and the percentage of the bag’s capacity filled.

This prototype can be tested **[here](https://packpack.herokuapp.com/)**...
