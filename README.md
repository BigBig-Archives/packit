A little project in Rails after 9 weeks at Le wagon.

I created Pack it, a small web application prototype, to improve the Ruby on Rails skills I acquiered at Le Wagon. The application is aimed as a tool for backpackers and hikers to help them plan what they will pack for their next trip. In this prototype, the user creates bags to prepare a journey, lists his travel accessories and finally packs part or the totality of them. The application displays packing details: the current load’s volume and weight (in liters and in kilos) and the percentage of the bag’s capacity filled.
